# Film Vault - Backend

Film Vault is a full-stack web application that allows users to search for films and build a personal film collection using data from the OMDb API.

## Features

- Search for films using the OMDb API
- View detailed film information
- Create a user account and log in
- Add and remove films from a personal collection
- Persist user collections using a PostgreSQL database

## Why I Built This

Film Vault was created for users who want a centralized reference for discovering films and managing what they have watched or own. It is especially useful for physical film collectors who want to digitally view and organize their collection in one easy-to-access location.

From a development perspective, I built Film Vault to practice full-stack concepts including RESTful APIs, database design, authentication, and React state management while working with a real third-party API.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- React
- JavaScript
- HTML / CSS

**Backend**
- Java
- Spring Boot
- REST APIs

**Database**
- PostgreSQL

**External APIs**
- OMDb API

## Running the Project Locally

### Backend
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a PostgreSQL database
3. Configure database credentials in `application.properties`
4. Run the Spring Boot application

### Frontend
1. Navigate to the frontend directory
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

## What I Learned

- Building RESTful APIs with Spring Boot
- Designing relational databases and managing relationships
- Integrating third-party APIs into a full-stack application
- Managing application state in React
- Handling asynchronous requests and error states

## Future Improvements

- Add user ratings and reviews
- Improve search filtering and sorting
- Add pagination for large search results
- Enhance UI/UX and mobile responsiveness
